                        <pre>Initially, our team expected to have over 20 participants in this event. however, due to some unanticipated
circumstances, this did not happen, and only 9 kids were able to participate. The event went well, we started
by giving brief introduction into how do algorithms work, then went through each level of code.org's "Maze"
course, and wrapped up by giving innoductory presentation about ADA University and distributing the certificates.
We have received a lot of positive feedback from the event! You can see the highlights in the Instagram post on the right.</pre>

                        <h3>More details:</h3>
                        <pre>We have started by analyzing the content of the files that were provided in the repository by Professor.
After we were done analyzing, we decided to distribute the workload, and only then we have
initiated the workflow. We managed to maintain a stable commit amount every day, which was
2-3 commits per day on average. Before doing the content of the pages, it was decided to
develop the navigation bar. In the meanwhile, the code-artist project was in development
paralelly. You can see the highlights from development in the Instagram post on the right.
